### Apparatus:

Laser light source, Michelson interferometer kit, optical bench, glass plate, meter scale.


### Procedure for performing the real lab:
 
#### To find the refractive index of the glass plate:
- Align the laser source and the interferometer as described in the procedure to find the wavelength of the laser source.
- Place the rotation stage perpendicular to the optical path, between the beam splitter and the movable mirror.
- Mount the glass plate on the rotation stage, aligned perpendicular to the optical path. When the glass plate is introduced, the fringes will be shifted and will become blurred.
- Make the fringes sharp again by moving the mirror mount with the micrometer.
- Rotate the rotation stage slowly and count the number of fringe shifts that occur as the table rotates from perpendicular (0Â°) to an angle $\theta$. The refractive index of the glass slide can be calculated using equation (1) on the theory page.

#### Procedure for performing the simulator:
 
- Using the combo box **Choose laser**, select the desired laser source.
- Switch ON the laser source using **Power On** button.
- A blurred fringe pattern will appear on the screen, shown in the zoomed view at the upper right corner of the simulator. Make the fringes sharp using the slider **Adjust Mirror**. Once a coarse adjustment has been made with the slider, the right and left arrow keys on the keyboard provide fine control of this adjustment.
- To find the refractive index of a glass plate, insert the glass plate in the laser beam using the button **Place glass plate**.
- Change the angle of incidence of light on the glass plate using the **Angle of rotation** slider. Note the number of fringes displaced. The refractive index n of the glass plate can be calculated using equation (1) from the theory page. Right and left arrow keys provide fine control.
- The thickness t of the glass plate can be changed using the **Thickness of glass plate** slider.
- The **Reset** button resets the whole experimental arrangement to its default (starting) configuration.
- The **Show results** button displays the results after doing the experiment.
- The experiment can be repeated for different laser sources and for glass plates of different thickness.
