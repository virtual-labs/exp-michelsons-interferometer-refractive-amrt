### Theory 

The Michelson interferometer is a historically important device which provides simple interferometric configuration for introducing basic principles. This device works under the principle of interference. Michelson Interferometers can be used to find out the refractive index of glass plates or thin films.

#### Measurement of refractive index of glass plate:
Consider a thin glass plate of thickness t and refractive index n, inserted normal to the path of one of the two interfering beams in Michelson interferometer. The optical path length of the beam through the plate is $nt$, while the optical path length through an equal thickness of air is just $t$, so the increase in optical path length caused by inserting the plate is (nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1)t. The beam traverses the plate twice, so the total path difference will be $2(n\lambda)t$. If N is the number of fringes displaced by inserting the plate, then $N\lambda=2(n)t$
